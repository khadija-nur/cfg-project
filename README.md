## **DISCOVER BORNEO**  
CFG Group Project - Introduction to Web Development  
Team members: *@khadija-nur* and *@estheraruma*

## About  
We used our newly learnt skills to create a multipage website about the island of Borneo; the food and orangutans.  
The website uses a bootstrap template and is configured to achieve the end results we wanted. 
The site is deployed using Netlify. 

## Navbar
We made a navbar that is responsive and changes color on scroll. It contains links to the **About** and **Contact** sections on the homepage as well as a link to the **Food** and **Orangutans** pages 

## Homepage  
We embedded a background hero video that autoplays when the website loads.  
The contact section contains an iframe with a map set to the CFG HQ in London and a live form connected with Netflify that will notify me whenever theres a submission.

## Food  
This page contains a hero parallax image and a modal (using venobox) showing the foods each with an outbound link and maximize button.  

## Orangutans  
This page contains a hero parallax image.  
The facts section has an info section that changes colour and orangutan image that zooms in on hover.  
The count/stats section has a ticker which counts up whenever page loads with custom icofont images.  
The Call to Action (CTA) section has a link to the next (how-to-help) section which has three responsive sub-sections with links to respective websites.
